### Welcome to this FED@IBM workshop!

Today weâ€™re going to work with the [hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) released in [`React v16.8`](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0). Weâ€™ll take a project built using the previous `React v16.7` release and leverage hooks to improve our code in terms of clarity, reusability and verbosity.

In our refactored codebase weâ€™ll make use of the following hooks:

- [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
- [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
- [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
- [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
- [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)

Although this isnâ€™t the full range of hooks released in `v16.8`, hopefully you can take enough away from today to use in your existing and future projects built with React - and the rest you can explore for yourself!

From a UI perspective weâ€™ll see no change in how our app looks "before hooks" and "after hooks". However our codebase and developer experience will certainly improve as a result. Perhaps not noticably on a project this size but at scale, with bigger products, larger development teams and quicker release cycles (as we experience at IBM) - the cleaner, clearer, and more reusable nature of hooks can have a real benefits day-to-day.

**Let's get started!**

## Outline

Did you know there are now 13 FED@IBM Branches?! And theyâ€™re spread right across the globe - from California to India! I thought it would be cool to visualize that geographically in the application for this workshop.

INTRODUCINGâ€¦ the **FED@IBM Weather Center** ðŸŒ¦

A simple app built using the Carbon Design System, for showing the weather info at each of our branches.

**Features include**:

- Displays the current weather info for each branch
- Displays todayâ€™s forecast for each branch
- Allows users to toggle temperature scale based on their preference (CÂ°/FÂ°)

### Code: As-is vs To-be

The as-is application built using `React v16.7` makes use of several popular React features (below). Although popular (and still very much relevant) within React, these concepts can at times be confusing to understand and verbose in terms of the amount of code needed to implement. Hooks will allow us to refactor these concepts to be clearer to read and easier understand.

| Feature                                                                  | `v16.7`: Before hooks                   | `v16.8`: After hooks                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [State management](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle)         | `this.state`, `this.setState()`         | [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)     |
| [Lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary#lifecycle-methods) | componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate   | [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)   |
| [Context API consumption](https://reactjs.org/docs/context)              | `Component.contextType`, `this.context` | [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) |
| [Render prop components](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props)          | See below                               | [Custom hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)              |

```
// Render prop component
<GetUser>
{
 ({ user, loading }) => loading ? 'Loading user...' : `Hello ${user.name}!`
}
</GetUser>
```

## Fork and Clone

This GitHub repository contains the code that we will be refactoring in today's workshop. At the root directory, you'll see 2 folders: `before-hooks` and `after-hooks`.

We will be working out of `before-hooks`, you can use `after-hooks` is what our finished code should _roughly_ look like. So you can use it for reference if need be.

### Fork

To begin, fork this repo to your GitHub account.

### Clone

Go to your forked repository, copy the SSH or HTTPS URL and in your terminal run the two commands to get the repository in your local file system and enter that directory.

```bash
$ git clone [your fork SSH/HTTPS]
$ cd fed-at-ibm-weather-center
```

### Add upstream remote

Add a remote called `upstream` so we can eventually submit a pull request once you have completed this tutorial step.

```bash
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:ShayMurnin/fed-at-ibm-weather-center.git
```

Or, if you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH with your remotes:

```bash
$ git remote add https://github.com/ShayMurnin/fed-at-ibm-weather-center.git
```

Verify that your forked repository remotes are correct:

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

Your terminal should output something like this:

```bash
origin	[your forked repo] (fetch)
origin	[your forked repo] (push)
upstream	git@github.com:ShayMurnin/fed-at-ibm-weather-center.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:ShayMurnin/fed-at-ibm-weather-center.git (push)
```
